  abstract  = "In the last chapter we defined implicit functions with
               $\phi$(x↦) $\leq$ 0 in the interior region $\Omega$-,
               $\phi$((x↦) > 0 in the exterior region $\Omega$+, and
               $\phi$((x↦) = 0 on the boundary $\partial$$\Omega$. Little was
               said about $\phi$ otherwise, except that smoothness is a
               desirable property especially in sampling the function or using
               numerical approximations. In this chapter we discuss signed
               distance functions, which are a subset of the implicit functions
               defined in the last chapter. We define signed distance functions
               to be positive on the exterior, negative on the interior, and
               zero on the boundary. An extra condition of |∇$\phi$(x↦)| = 1 is
               imposed on a signed distance function.",

    abstract={In this paper, we propose a numerical method for computing the signed distance function to a discrete domain, on an arbitrary triangular background mesh. It mainly relies on the use of some theoretical properties of the unsteady Eikonal equation. Then we present a way of adapting the mesh on which computations are held to enhance the accuracy for both the approximation of the signed distance function and the approximation of the initial discrete contour by the induced piecewise affine reconstruction, which is crucial when using this signed distance function in a context of level set methods. Several examples are presented to assess our analysis, in two or three dimensions.},

    abstract = {The quality of computer generated images of three-dimensional scenes depends on the shading technique used to paint the objects on the cathode-ray tube screen. The shading algorithm itself depends in part on the method for modeling the object, which also determines the hidden surface algorithm. The various methods of object modeling, shading, and hidden surface removal are thus strongly interconnected. Several shading techniques corresponding to different methods of object modeling and the related hidden surface algorithms are presented here. Human visual perception and the fundamental laws of optics are considered in the development of a shading rule that provides better quality and increased realism in generated images.},
