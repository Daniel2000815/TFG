  abstract  = "In the last chapter we defined implicit functions with
               $\phi$(x↦) $\leq$ 0 in the interior region $\Omega$-,
               $\phi$((x↦) > 0 in the exterior region $\Omega$+, and
               $\phi$((x↦) = 0 on the boundary $\partial$$\Omega$. Little was
               said about $\phi$ otherwise, except that smoothness is a
               desirable property especially in sampling the function or using
               numerical approximations. In this chapter we discuss signed
               distance functions, which are a subset of the implicit functions
               defined in the last chapter. We define signed distance functions
               to be positive on the exterior, negative on the interior, and
               zero on the boundary. An extra condition of |∇$\phi$(x↦)| = 1 is
               imposed on a signed distance function.",
